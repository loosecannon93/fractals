Newtown fractals
========

See [This slideshow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Tsx3DGGPp3mlM489RzXlOVKxjVE2h6XR21Qs02qTk6Q/edit?usp=sharing) for a more detailed description of this project. 

Generates newtown fractals from compelx equations. 

Only the C implementations is fleshed out

Includes a parser and lexical analyzer using Yacc/Bison and Lex/flex which parses a string representing a generalized complex expression. 
Then iterates over this expression using newtowns method to produce fractal images. 

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_fractal. 

See the images in c/img for pretty results.
